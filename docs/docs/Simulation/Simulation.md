# Simulation in Gazebo

Here's we'll discuss several parts of setting up a simulation environment in Gazebo:

1. Defining 1 main chassis urdf and 4 wheel urdfs
2. Connecting the above urdfs to create a simple robot (using xacro)
3. Adding robot to a simple world
4. Adding Twisted Fields controller to move the robot
5. Improving Wheel Module Visulas by CAD -> SDF -> DAE -> URDF (and replacing with existing wheel urdf)
6. Improving Chassis Visuals
7. Building a fancy outdoor world (or using an existing one)
8. Adding real plants to the world
9. Adding a camera to the robot
